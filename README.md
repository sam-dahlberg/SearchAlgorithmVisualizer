This project was practice to work with algorithms, GUI's in Python, and implementing a MVC pattern in Python. 

Currently has 3 search algorithms, BFS, DFS, and A*. Has the ability to draw and erase walls on a tile grid, move the start and end point, and restart the program. The algorithm will be shown step by step in the GUI, showing what tiles it has searched and queued up, until the final path is shown.
